Custom Hooks
Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that use other hooks. They help share stateful logic that we may otherwise need to reuse throughout our application. For example, we may create custom hooks for commonly used effects such as form handling, animations, timers, etc.

As a convention, custom hooks should have names that start with use. Additionally, they should also follow the rules of hooks. Otherwise, they don’t need to have a specific design — the developer gets to decide what arguments it takes, and if it should return anything.
